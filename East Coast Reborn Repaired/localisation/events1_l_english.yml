But this is only an isolated case; even more important, therefore, the operation for using the vaccine lasted for several days, and for all the research time it turned out that the vaccine does not give a 100% guarantee, 37% of the vaccinees die and the remaining 73% survive, but in spite of this, this is a success ...
